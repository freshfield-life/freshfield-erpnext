# Data Governance â€” Phase 2+

- **Classification:** public docs vs internal SOPs vs transactional exports
- **Access:** least privilege per agent and connector
- **Retention:** docs & embeddings rotated on schedule; delete stale snapshots
- **Provenance:** store source/section/version for every RAG chunk
- **Exports:** sanitize PII before any dataset leaves production
