# Freshfield ERPNext Project Rules

## Mission & Scope
**Goal:** Run ERPNext v15 (stable) in parallel with current tools, validate inventory and subcontracting flows, then gate into integrations.

**Phase 1 Scope:** Vanilla ERPNext setup for Canada/PST with subcontracting focus
- Locale: Canada, TZ: PST
- Currencies: CAD (base), transact in CAD/USD/GBP/EUR
- Manufacturing: Subcontracting only (contract manufacturers)
- No code edits, no SQL, no destructive operations

## Core Guardrails
1. **Stay within Phase 1 scope**; ask before expanding
2. **Cite official ERPNext docs** by title/section for non-trivial steps
3. **No code edits**, no SQL, no destructive ops
4. **Backup before risky changes**; confirm before stock/ledger postings
5. **Update STATE_TRACKER.md and CHANGELOG.md** after each task

## One-Task-at-a-Time Workflow
1. **Single Focus**: Work on one task completely before starting another
2. **State Tracking**: Update `STATE_TRACKER.md` after each completed task
3. **Changelog**: Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md`
4. **QA Check**: Verify task completion meets acceptance criteria
5. **Backup**: Ensure data safety before any risky operations
