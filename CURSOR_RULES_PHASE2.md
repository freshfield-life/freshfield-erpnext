# Cursor Rules â€” Phase 2+ (Code Allowed, Safety First)

1) **Obey phase boundaries.** Only implement Phase 2 tasks unless explicitly promoted.
2) **PRs only.** Never commit to `main`. Create branches, open PRs with checklists.
3) **Design before code.** Propose a micro design and mapping before writing connectors.
4) **No secrets in repo.** Use placeholders and Secret Manager notes.
5) **Shadow first.** New flows run in Shadow mode until approved to Assist.
6) **Citations.** For RAG and API, cite docs/specs in PR descriptions.
7) **Tests required.** Include golden fixtures or unit tests for any parser/mapping.
8) **State updates.** Update `STATE_TRACKER.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` on every PR.
