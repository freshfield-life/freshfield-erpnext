# AI Rules & Guardrails — Phase 1

1) Stay within Phase 1 scope; ask before expanding
2) Cite official ERPNext docs by title/section for non‑trivial steps
3) **No code edits**, no SQL, no destructive ops
4) Backup before risky changes; confirm before stock/ledger postings
5) Update `STATE_TRACKER.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` after each task
